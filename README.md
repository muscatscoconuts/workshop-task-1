There are five main coding concepts : variables, conditionals, loops, functions, objects
How can we make a shape bounce back?? Or change direction
 - to make it go backwards x - 5 won’t make it go back because x is reaching a number greater than the width, while simultaneously trying to add to x
Can make another variable e.g. move
Repeat loop will create new things and use logic to stop
Wire (?) loop - 
X += 5
Variable, exit condition and incrementation (x = ; x < ; x +=)
for loop
Put code in to define what the function does
 
# Code glossary
noStroke - no outline shape

while -  used to set parameter for loop??

for - can make shortened version of while loop

functions - blocks of code that have names that can be used to execute that bit of code

# workshop 1 task ////
i want to make a loop that continues to produce the word “wow!” in different colors randomly on the canvas — need to make function for “wow!” and colors and then loop.
learnt how to create text :) 
managed to set random variables for textSize and position of the text, created function.
set the wows to occur when mouse is over certain area of canvas so there’s a surprise!
 —  couldn’t figure out how to do that so instead made a loop to put a yellow wow in middle of screen.
if i put the background before the code for frame rate the wows disappear after being drawn… can’t decide whether i like it better than filling the screen with lots of wow decided i liked appearing and disappearing. My dad helped me do the code to make the yellow surprise text change size!
